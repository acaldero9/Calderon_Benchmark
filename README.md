This folder contains many MCNP6 input files used to model a PWR in accordance to the BEAVERS Report, by the MIT Computational Reactor Physics Group.

The repository contains code that models the geometry and interactions for a 1.6% enriched fuel assembly
The file titled 2.4asmbly contains code that models the geometry for a 2.4% enriched fuel assembly.
The file titled 3.2asmbly contains code that models the geometry for a 3.2% enriched fuel assembly.
I have broken the full core model into two parts: control rods fully inserted and controls completely withdrawn.
