This folder contains many MCNP6 input files used to model a PWR in accordance to the BEAVERS Report, by the MIT Computational Reactor Physics Group.
The file titled centroentero contains code that models the full core geometry.
The file titled 1.6asmbly contains code that models the geometry for a 1.6% enriched fuel assembly.
The file titled 2.4asmbly contains code that models the geometry for a 2.4% enriched fuel assembly.
The file titled 3.2asmbly contains code that models the geometry for a 3.2% enriched fuel assembly.
